# Random-Number

## About
This is a simple web about random number which is written in javascript DOM. I create it after learning the basic javascript DOM and try to implemented it.

## How it works
There is a two inputs with Lower Input and Upper Input from 1 to 100, which will be choose randomly after clicking button "Generate". 
If user click empty one input or both input fields it will return NaN. 
If user generate random number from -1 or 0 to 100 it will return alert "low should be bigger than one and smaller then up".
If user generate random number from 1 but to more than 100 it will return alert "Up cannot be grater than 100!

## What features was used

### Math.random()
The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.

### Math.floor()

The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
